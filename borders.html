			 Common Emitter (CE) amplifiers are designed to produce a large output
			 voltage swing from a relatively small input signal voltage of only a
			 few milli volt’s and are used mainly as “small signal amplifiers.” 

		</div>	
		<div class="border1">
			The efficiency of this type of circuit is very low (less than 30%) 
			and delivers small power outputs for a large drain on the DC power supply.
			A Class A amplifier stage passes the same load current even when no input 
			signal is applied so large heat sinks are needed for the output transistors.
		</div>
		<div class="border2">
			 So the overall conversion efficiency ( η ) of the amplifier is greater than
			 that of the equivalent Class A with efficiencies reaching as high as 70%
			 possible resulting in nearly all modern types of push-pull amplifiers operated
			 in this Class B mode.
		</div>
		<div class="border3">
			  The Class B Amplifier has the big advantage over their Class A amplifier cousins 
			  in that no current flows through the transistors when they are in their quiescent 
			  state (ie, with no input signal), therefore no power is dissipated in the output 
			  transistors or transformer.
		</div>  
		<div class="border4">
				 The term complementary arises from the fact that one transistor is N-P-N type 
				 and the other is P-N-P type. They have symmetry as they are made with the same 
				 material and technology and are of same maximum rating.
